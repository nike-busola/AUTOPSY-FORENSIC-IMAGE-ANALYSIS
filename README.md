# AUTOPSY-FORENSIC-IMAGE-ANALYSIS
This repository contains a forensic image analysis report conducted using **Autopsy**, an open-source digital forensics platform. The analysis focuses on simulating a digital autopsy of a forensic image to demonstrate the basic workflow and data extraction process.

Project Overview

Title: Forensic Image Analysis with Autopsy  

Author: Adenike Oluwabusola Oni  

Tool Used: [Autopsy](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/)

This exercise demonstrates how to:

- Create a new case in Autopsy

- Add and configure data sources

- Perform ingest analysis

- Generate a forensic case report


Procedure Summary

   - Fill in case and optional information

   - Save and proceed

2. Add Data Source

   - Select host

   - Choose data source type and data type

   - Configure ingest modules

   - Add and process data

3. Analyze Results

   - Review files, artifacts, and metadata

4. Generate Report
